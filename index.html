      <h1>My Journey to Epicodus</h1>

      <p>I previously worked as a Qualified Mental Health Associate “QMHA” for 10 years at a major non-profit organization that
      serves youth in Oregon. In order to advance myself further, it would be crucial for me to get more schooling or advanced
      training.</p>
      <p>In late 2016 and 2017, I worked for about 6 months as a Chripractice Assistant, but it ended up being only a job I was able to commit to part-time. On Christmas Day 2016 I returned to the parent company I had previosuly worked for.</p>
      <p>This time I was working with older teens in a more reality based program called Sender House.  Here I would be assisting and supporting "Residents" with necessary life skills like cooking, cleaning, laundry, job searching, resume building, etc.</p>
      <p>My job at the Sender House was stable and a less stressful environment than I previously worked in. That allowed me to
      get married in 2018 and provided me the opportunity to stay home for 5 weeks, with accrued sick time, after the birth of
      my son in Spring 2019.</p>
      <p>That 5 weeks at home with my family gave me the time I needed to evaluate what my next steps would be and I chose to
      begin looking into trade work. In Late 2018, I applied and completed testing to become an Apprentice Electrician.
      This proved to be a long process, and when I was offered a position, it coincided with the birth of my son.  It was more important to me that I was home with him and my wife at that time so I chose to turn down the offer.</p>
      <p>In November 2019 I attended a workshop at Epicodus in Portland to learn more about the courses offered. I was completely
      new to the coding and web development field, but I became excited to work with computers and the thought of building
      digital projects was really appealing</p>
