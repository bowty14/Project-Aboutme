      <h1>My Journey to Epicodus</h1>

      <p>I previously worked as a Qualified Mental Health Associate “QMHA” for 10 years at a major non-profit organization that
      serves youth in Oregon. In order to advance myself further, it would be crucial for me to get more schooling or advanced
      training.</p>
      <p>In late 2016 and 2017, I worked for about 6 months as a Chripractice Assistant, but it ended up being only a job I was able to commit to part-time. On Christmas Day 2016 I returned to the parent company I had previosuly worked for.</p>
      <p>This time I was working with older teens in a more reality based, Independent Living Skills training-type environment.  Here I would be assisting a supporting "Residents" with necessary life skills like cooking, cleaning, laundry, job searching, resume building, etc.</p>

      <p>With the birth of my son Grady in Spring 2019, It became time to make a big decision</p>
